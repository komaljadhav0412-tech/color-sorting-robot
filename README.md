# color-sorting-robot
Automation project using RoboDK for color-based object sorting.
# 🤖 Color Sorting Robot - RoboDK Automation Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an **automation system** that sorts objects based on their **color** using **RoboDK simulation** and a robotic arm mechanism.  
It is a **hardware + simulation project** (no programming code), focused on applying **automation and robotics concepts** for industrial use cases.

## ⚙️ Features
- Simulates robot arm movement in **RoboDK**.
- Detects object color using a **sensor/vision-based concept**.
- Automatically sorts objects into different bins.
- Demonstrates **automation in material handling**.
- Can be extended for real-world **industrial sorting systems**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **RoboDK** (for simulation)  
- **Robotic Arm** (simulated/hardware setup)  
- **Color Sensor / Vision System** (for detection)  
- **Conveyor & Sorting Mechanism** (automation setup)

## 📂 Project Structure
- `roboDK_files/` → Simulation files (`.rdk`)  
- `docs/` → Project report, diagrams, flowcharts  
- `results/` → Images & videos of working demo  

---

## 🚀 How it Works
1. Objects are placed on the conveyor.  
2. A **color sensor/vision system** detects the object’s color.  
3. The robot arm (simulated in RoboDK) picks up the object.  
4. The object is placed into the correct **bin** based on color.
